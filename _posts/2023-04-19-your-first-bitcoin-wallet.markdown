It's time to own your first stash of Bitcoin, but where do you start? How do I make sure it is safe and secure? What is a wallet anyway?

If you takeaway only one thing from this article, let it be this: <strong>if you can remember 12 words, you can own bitcoin</strong>. It's really that simple. Let's get to it.

<h4>1. Download the wallet application</h4>

There are many outstanding wallets on the market today for desktop or mobile, and having tried numerous, I have to say [Blue Wallet][bluewallet] is one of the easiest to set up for beginners, has a very intuitive user experience, and is downloadable on both [iOS][blueios] and [Android][blueandroid]. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use [Blue Wallet][bluewallet], but if you would like to dive in and explore others, check out this [more extensive list][bitcoinerguidewallets].

<h4>2. Create your first wallet</h4>

A wallet is just a way to control your bitcoin. It holds keys (like a password) that are unique to you. The keys enable access to your coins and grant the ability to send your bitcoin without permission. Let's create one.

After downloading, open [Blue Wallet][bluewallet] and select "Add a wallet".

Name your wallet something cool, and select "Bitcoin" as the type. Select "Create".

<h4>3. Secure your seed phrase</h4>

<strong>This is the most important step.</strong> The next step of the setup will reveal 12 words--this is your seed phrase! These 12 words are what give you access to your Bitcoin in the wallet. It doesn't matter if you lose your phone, you can still access your Bitcoin from any wallet on any device by importing these 12 words. So it is crucial you take thoughtful care of them.

On the flip side, if any "enemies" get ahold of these 12 words, they can steal your money. Don't write them down and leave them on the fridge, don't show them to your ex, and definitely don't take a picture of them and upload it to iCloud or any other hosting service without encryption.

Write them down, make multiple copies, and store them somewhere safe. Or you can get creative: write a poem that includes the words, engrave them in a [steel plate][seedplate] in case your house burns down. It really doesn't matter how you do it, but the bottom line is you need to make sure you will never forget these words and no one who can't be trusted will ever get access to them. Figure out what works best for you, and do that.

<h4>4. That's it! You are ready to receive bitcoin</h4>
Now that you know how to custody it correctly, you are ready to buy some bitcoin. We'll go over how to buy your first bitcoin in the next tutorial.
